Yumi is a terminal-based JavaScript reconnaissance and P1 bug bounty hunting tool that automatically collects JavaScript files from a domain and its subdomains, scans for sensitive information, and helps bug bounty hunters find critical security vulnerabilities with ease.

---

## Features

- Automatic enumeration of subdomains and JavaScript files
- Bulk download and scanning of JS files for sensitive keys, secrets, and endpoints
- Detects common P1 bug bounty vulnerabilities such as API keys, tokens, hardcoded passwords, and more
- Fancy terminal UI with ASCII art logo and loading animations
- JSON and console report generation
- Extensible plugin system for custom scanning rules

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install in editable mode for development:

```
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line with a target domain:

```
yumi example.com
```

You will see a colorful loading screen, followed by enumeration and scan results. A detailed JSON report is saved as `report.json`.
